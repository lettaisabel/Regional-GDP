# Regional-GDP
A UC Berkeley ECON148 project

### Regional Heterogeneity: Varying Economic Performance in US Counties
In the first project of Econ 148, we will examine county-level economic performance as measured by real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the past two decades. As the most important macroeconomic indicator, GDP is often analyzed at the country level; however, regional heterogeneity is also a crucial source of variation in growth and business cycle analysis. Therefore, in this project we will use a county-level real GDP dataset from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and try to find out the regional differences in economic performance, especially during recessions.

You will use the data cleaning and data manipulation skills you have learned so far in this course to wrangle this rich, but rather complex, real-world dataset. 

#### Data sources: 

The main dataset we will use in this notebook is ["CAGDP9: Real GDP in Chained Dollars by County and MSA"](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-county-metro-and-other-areas) from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). It provides a comprehensive measure of the gross domestic product of counties, metropolitan statistical areas, and some other local areas in the United States from 2001 to the present. Accessed Jan 2023. **We use a subset of the full dataset (about 50%) that includes some of the industries available in the original dataset.**

We will also use the ["United States Counties Database"](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-counties) from Simplemaps.com. Specifically, we will use the geographic data of U.S. counties (i.e., latitude and longitude) to create the visualizations in the last section. Accessed Jun 2022.
