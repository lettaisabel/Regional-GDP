# Regional GDP
A UC Berkeley **ECON148: Data Science for Economists** project

#### Regional Heterogeneity: Varying Economic Performance in US Counties
In this project, we aim to examine economic performance at the county level, utilizing real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data spanning the last twenty years. While GDP is predominantly examined as a national macroeconomic metric, regional heterogeneity also play a significant role in shaping economic growth and business cycle fluctuations. To delve into these regional variations in economic performance, particularly during economic recessions, we will employ a dataset focused on county-level real GDPs, sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

#### Data sources: 
The main dataset we will use in this notebook is ["CAGDP9: Real GDP in Chained Dollars by County and MSA"](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-county-metro-and-other-areas) from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). It provides a comprehensive measure of the gross domestic product of counties, metropolitan statistical areas, and some other local areas in the United States from 2001 to the present. Accessed Jan 2023. **We use a subset of the full dataset (about 50%) that includes some of the industries available in the original dataset.**

We will also use the ["United States Counties Database"](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-counties) from Simplemaps.com. Specifically, we will use the geographic data of U.S. counties (i.e., latitude and longitude) to create the visualizations in the last section. Accessed Jun 2022.
